        "\n",
        "2. Select the 'Database' option on the left-hand pane, which will navigate to the Database Deployment page, where there is a deployment specification of any existing cluster. Create a new database cluster by clicking on the \"+Create\" button.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   Select all the applicable configurations for the database cluster. Once all the configuration options are selected, click the “Create Cluster” button to deploy the newly created cluster. MongoDB also enables the creation of free clusters on the “Shared Tab”.\n",
